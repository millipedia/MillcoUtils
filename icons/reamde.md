The icons in this folder currently are mostly taken from the [IBM Carbon icon set](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/main/packages/icons) which have an Apache 2.0 License.

Some other icons have been included - all with open source licenses though.

I've been using the [iconify design icon sets tool](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) to grab the ones I've needed so far.

For consistency I've been exporting them from iconify with currentColor and a width / height of 1em.
